# Fast_Logistics

This project is a SQL-based database management system designed to help businesses manage their logistics operations. 
It includes four tables - customers, orders, products, and order_items - with various attributes such as customer name, order date, product price, and quantity sold.
The database allows businesses to track customer orders and product sales, analyze revenue generated by each product, find top customers by total spending, and identify customers with multiple orders.

The project includes SQL queries that can be used to retrieve valuable information from the database, such as customer order amounts, total quantity sold for each product, and details of all orders.
It also includes more complex queries, such as finding the average amount spent by customers on each order, 
customers who have made more than one order and their respective order dates, and orders that have more than one product and their respective product names
